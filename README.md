## Behavior to expect

- User can input their email on `/` and click "Sign In"
- Email input validation errors will show as a console error
- Clicking "Sign In" will take user to `/sign-in`
- User can input their email and password on `sign-in`
- An empty email or an invalid email will result in error messages
- An empty password will result in an error message
- Submitting the form with "email@email.com" and "password" will successfully take the user to `/browse`
- Submitting the form with any other email or password will result in error messages
  - (Pssst... Implementation can be seen in `SignInPage`, starting with `handleSubmit`)
